### Slideshow Vs Carousel

Can Slideshow component be replaced with Carousel component?
Yes only by adding some additional API functionalities

Slideshow accepts - gutterPx(any pixel values)
Carousel - has predefined gutter values

Slideshow - accepts lazyload - defaults to true
Carousel - accepts Virtualization props similar to lazy load - defaults false

Slideshow - indexToShow - which slide should be visible at first
Carousel - displays bunch of cards together in the same view - trying to make carousel display one card at a time, if that's achieved, then we can introduce this prop to say which slide/card should be visible first.

To make the above functionality work, we'll have to set width 100% to cover the full view and make changes in the renderChildren function, as well as ensure lazy load separately. Else, we can go with the usage of virtualization props and then ignore itemWidths(but itemWidths is needed for virtualization to work)


To implement lazy load thingy - we'll have to pass virtualization props - only in here we can pass itemWidth. 
Is there a way to not pass width and also implement lazyload in carousel?

**What does snap prop in Carousel do?**
Controls scroll snap behaviour inside a carousel

Will it be better to add **role="list" and role="list-item"** in Carousel component container div and their children?
